# RL-for-ramp-metring-on-highways

The goal of this project is to utilize Q-learning and Deep Q-learning algorithms through numerical simulation to optimize ramp metering control on a highway. The simulation focuses on a specific highway stretch with a configurable number of lanes, where an entry ramp is regulated by a traffic light. SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) is employed to simulate car-following and lane-changing behaviors. The Q-learning algorithm is tasked with optimizing traffic flow on both the highway stretch and the ramp by controlling the ramp's traffic light.
